# AstroGIS-TRIO: (Technology driven Remote sensing Innovators in Orthomapping)

I developed a data-driven traffic analysis and visualization for Bengaluru focused on identifying and addressing the city's traffic congestion issues. The project uses open-source datasets, including traffic data, and integrates them with geographic information systems (GIS) to provide a spatial representation of how traffic dynamics are influenced by urban infrastructure and physical geography. What Did I Develop? I created a comprehensive analysis of traffic patterns in Bengaluru, combining: Data visualizations (e.g., traffic volume trends, congestion levels by area).

My project directly addresses this by: Visualizing traffic congestion spatially to show which areas of Bengaluru face the highest congestion levels. Exploring environmental influences like weather on traffic volume and how certain geographic features (like road networks and green spaces) impact traffic flow. Providing data-driven insights that can inform city planners, traffic authorities, and residents on where infrastructure improvements or policy changes are needed to reduce congestion.

The insights from this project can help alleviate these issues. Improving quality of life: Efficient traffic management reduces commute times, improves air quality, and enhances the daily lives of the city's residents. By providing a holistic view of Bengaluruâ€™s traffic issues through data and geographic analysis, this project offers actionable insights that can contribute to a more sustainable and livable city.
